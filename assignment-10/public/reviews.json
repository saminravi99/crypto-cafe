    "review": "The doctor as very humble and apologized for not doing a good job of selling the procedure.My heart ached to see it was a true situation of fear and insecurity, and that they would have done anything to help.He didn't even get paid extra!the doctor said that is very strong.I do not know why but I was convinced the heartbeat was 130"

    "review": "I ended up getting the procedure done on Friday, and since then the swelling and the lump have been gone.I had a follow up ultrasound this morning to make sure all was well.The lump has also completely vanished. Our little bundle of joy (at least for the moment) is perfectly healthy, perfect weight, perfect height, perfect everything."

    "review": "So I can say with total confidence, I would not do my family the injustice of crossing this place and put them at risk.I would have opted to visit a reputable clinic if I was going to be stuck for the weekend.I was unable to read the rest of the site as I had to leave.However, please understand I will not be checking your place out again."
